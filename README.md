# predictive-maintenance of machines using IoT
This repository contains the complete implementation of a Predictive Maintenance System designed to monitor machine health using IoT-based sensor data, clustering, and a deep learning LSTM model.
The system predicts motor status as Normal, Moderate Chance of Failure, or Alert (Possible Failure) based on temperature, current, and vibration data.
